# Elastic search 6.x.x tutorial using Python API

This repository is a tutorial inspired in [this repository](https://github.com/o19s/relevant-search-book) from the book [Relevant Search.](https://www.manning.com/books/relevant-search)
 Since It wasn't easy going through the elastic search python API documentation I decided to use python 3 and curl. 

There are examples about:

- How to search
- Analyze and explain search
- Configure settings fon an index.

You need to install [elastic search 6.x.x](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html) and the python [API](https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/).
